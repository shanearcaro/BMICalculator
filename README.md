# BMI Calcualtor App

This project is a BMI Calcualtor app that was written in Kotlin and used Android Studio. The project follows the instructions by Greg Lim in his book "Beginning Android Development with Kotlin". Everything in the book was followed except for synthetic calls were not used to find element variables as it has been depreciated and does not work with Java code. I understand that using findViewById() is not the best way of doing it, but I am using it for now as this is my first app. The other changes I made to the code was a changing background color for the different levels of BMI score (underweight, normal, overweight, obese), and I added a back button so BMI calculations can be constantly redone without having to exit the app. I'm not going to develop this app furthur as it was used to get familiar with how Android development works. I am going to continue to program the projects in the book and edit them as I see fit.
